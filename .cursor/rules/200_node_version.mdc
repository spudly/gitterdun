# Node Version Management

Always use the Node.js version specified in the `.nvmrc` file at the project root.

## Instructions for Cursor

1. **Terminal Commands**: Before running any npm, node, or terminal commands, ensure you're using the correct Node version by checking that `node --version` returns the correct version number, as specified in the `.nvmrc` file at the project root.

2. **Installation Reminder**: If the required Node version is not installed, stop and inform the user that they need to install it.

3. **Consistency**: Always prefer nvm for Node version management over other package managers like Homebrew for this project.

## Verification

You can verify the correct Node version is active by running:

```bash
node --version
```
